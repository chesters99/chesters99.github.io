                    text="<b>This visualization provides the ability to analyze Health and Life Expectancy across 500 cities in the United
                    States. It uses an Interactive Slideshow approach to guide the user through each scene of the analysis, while encouraging
                    exploration at each scene. </b><br><br>

                    <b>Scene Functionality</b><br>
                    1) The Overall Health Map provides an overview of the relative overall health of each of 500 cities across the USA. Circle 
                    size is used to indicate population, and a red though white to blue color spectum indicates overall health. A state zoom
                    function enables a clearer view of cities within the more crowded states. The Health Measures bar chart, below the map, shows
                    various health and life expectancy measures for the clicked city, and defaults to show the national average. To allow easy visual 
                    comparison to this national average, a black line is shown across all bars when a city is selected.<br>

                    2) The Life Expectancy Map shows the variation in average life expectancy in cities across the United States, and operates
                    in essentially the same manner as the Overall Health Map described above.<br>

                    3) The Life Expectancy Wealth Gap Map shows the gap in life expectancy between the wealthy (top income quartile), and
                    and the poor (bottom income quartile), and operates in essentially the same manner at the Overall Health Map described 
                    above.<br>

                    4) The Life Expectancy vs Overall Health scatterplot shows four data points of Overall Health and Life Expectancy per
                    city, one for each income quartile, and is activated by mouse hover. It allows exploration of gaps in life expectancy between
                    income groups, and promotes exploration of extreme cities. Clicking a city updates the Health Measures bar chart.<br>

                    5) The Top Cities table allows exploration by highest and lowest of various measurements by column sorting. Clicking
                    a city name updates the Health Measures bar chart.<br><br>

                    <b>Hybrid Structure: </b> This visualization follows the Interactive Slideshow hybrid structure, consisting of five scenes
                    that are somewhat more Reader Driven than Author Driven. The structure guides the user though the available scenes and 
                    encourages interactive data exploration at each scene. The scenes are designed to provide a variety of ways to explore
                    different aspects of the available data.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Scenes: </b>A common template structure is used across each scene with a overview/selection area (containing map, 
                    scatterplot or table) above a detailed bar chart showing national or city specific Health Measures. The three map-based scenes 
                    are essentially identical in look and feel and only differ in the data they display. All scenes are designed to provide both
                    an overview and a way of selecting cities to see in more detail either with mouse hover for a tooltip, or a mouse click to 
                    update the Health Measures bar chart. The scatterplot scene offers a different perspective on the data where trends, gaps in 
                    life expectancy and extreme values can be easily observed. The Top Cities table offers a highest/lowest approach to city 
                    navigation. Transitions between scenes keep the user oriented by firstly tab buttons remaining fixed in place with the current
                    scene highlighted, and secondly the alignment of the two main screen areas is kept constant. Transitions are also used for 
                    map drill-down to a specific state (using D3 transitions), and showing parts of bordering states are used to keep 
                    the user oriented. Messaging is used on each scene to prompt the type of questions that the scene can be used to answer, 
                    and to provide additional information via tooltips.<br><br>

                    <b>Annotations: </b>On each scene a bolded initial question or two are used to inform the user of some of the available
                    functionality on that scene. The annotations on the three map scenes are partly static (highlighting the best and worst cities,
                    and pulsing the circle for Champaign, IL.), but in order to minimise clutter, they are mostly dynamic (i.e. tooltips). The 
                    tooltips follow a common template across all maps. The tooltips appear on mouse hover and clear when the mouse is moved away. The 
                    annotation on the scatterplot is to pulse Champaign, IL., and a dynamic annotation highlights the 4 data points for a hovered 
                    city. The annotation for the Top Cities table shows an up or down arrow on a column that is selected for sorting.<br><br>

                    <b>Parameters: </b>The key parameters are firstly which chart to show for each tab (and also tracks the current
                    state i.e. tab), secondly on each scene a city parameter can be set by mouse click which drives the health measures bar
                    chart, thirdly a state parameter can be set on the three map scenes for zoom/drilldown, and fourthly in the Top Cities scene
                    a column sort parameter is set by mouse click on a particular table column.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Triggers: </b>The key trigger is a mouse click to select the scene, and this is highlighted in a set of tabs which have 
                    arrows to indicate the recommended sequence of the scenes. There are four triggers on the map screens,
                    one by mouse click selects a state to zoom in, one by mouse click selects a city to display the health measures bar chart,
                    one by mouse hover on a city shows a summary tooltip about that city, and one by mouse hover over a bar chart bar which shows
                    more details about that bar. There are three triggers for the scatterplot screen, one by mouse over to highlight the four data
                    points for that city, one by mouse click to select the city for the health measures bar chart, and one by mouse hover over a 
                    bar chart bar which shows more details about that bar. There are two triggers on the Top Cities scene, one by mouse hover to
                    highlight which table cells have a function, one by mouse click to select a table column for sorting, and one by mouse hover
                    over a bar chart bar which shows more details about that bar.<br><br>
